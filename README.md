## 📌 Problem Statement

*Predict Hospital Readmission Risk for Patients with Chronic Conditions*

Hospital readmissions, especially among patients with chronic illnesses (like diabetes, heart disease, or hypertension), are a major challenge for the healthcare system. Early identification of patients at high risk of readmission allows providers to intervene and improve outcomes.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. *Explore key risk factors and trends* that affect patient readmission.
2. *Predict readmission risk* using a Machine Learning model.
3. *Provide actionable recommendations* to reduce unnecessary hospital readmissions.

## 🧠 Approach Overview

1. *Data Preprocessing*  
   - Handled missing values and outliers  
   - Encoded categorical variables  
   - Performed feature engineering

2. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*  
   - Identified high-risk conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension)  
   - Correlation and feature importance analysis

3. *Model Building*  
   - Tried various ML algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression)  
   - Chose the best model based on F1-score and ROC-AUC  
   - Performed hyperparameter tuning

4. *Model Evaluation*  
   - Used confusion matrix, classification report  
   - ROC-AUC curve for model effectiveness

5. *Recommendations*  
   - Early discharge planning  
   - Focused follow-up for high-risk groups  
   - Better chronic care coordination

## 💡 Key Findings

- Patients with diabetes and older age groups are more prone to readmission.
- Longer hospital stays correlate with higher readmission rates.
- Medication adherence and timely follow-ups significantly reduce risks.
